PC MEMBERS GUIDELINES
---------------------

We recedived 7 submission. Each PC member will have to review one paper, according to the procedure detailed as follows.


1. OBTAIN A GITHUB ACCOUNT
In order to be able to participate in the review process you will need a GitHub account.
If you have not got one yet, please go to https://github.com and sign up for an account.


2. ACCESS SUBMISSION
Submissions PDF files are posted on this repository (https://github.com/opencert/workshop-2019/) in form of issues.
Go to the repository web page and click on the tab "Issues" to access submissions
(page https://github.com/opencert/workshop-2019/issues).
Then click on "Submission n (.../...)" to access submission number n. Title, abstract and PDF file (link at the bottom) are the same
as the ones available on Easychair. On Easychair you can also find the submission metadata.
Please note that without a GitHub you can see the repository (https://github.com/opencert/workshop-2019/) including the
issues (https://github.com/opencert/workshop-2019/issues), but you cannot post comments.


3. SELF-ASSIGN SUBMISSIONS TO REVIEW
Each PC member should self assign ONE submission to review by posting the following signed message in the related issue
of thethe chosen submission:

     I will review this submission.
     Your-name Your-surname
     
Only choose submissions labelled "available for review". Note that initially all submissions are labelled in this way.
Before self-assigning the submission make sure that the submission has not been self-assigned by the maximum number of
PC members: 4 PC members for short papers and 5 PC members for regular papers.
The deadline for self-assigning the review is Monday 21 July 2019.
If by the deadline you haven't self-assigned a submission yet or you have self-assigned a submission that had already
enough reviewers, then the Program Co-chairs will choose the submission to assign to you.
Once the assignements of all submissions are completed, they will be entered on Easychair.


4. REVIEW PROCESS
The review process consists of the following three phases:

a) INTERACTIVE PHASE (from now until Sunday 4 August)
   You will be able to interact with the authors and you are expected to provide feedback to the authors throughout
   this review phase. You may put questions to the authors and ask for clarifications.
   Authors are expected to consider your comments, revise their submission and upload it in the issue by Sunday 4 August.
   
b) ASSESSMENT PHASE (from Monday 5 August until Sunday 11 August)
   You will need to evaluate the revised submission to assess whether the authors have revised the submission according
   the reviewers' comments. By Sunday 11 August you have to upload your review on Easychair.
   The review form is structured as follows:
   (1) highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the initial submission;
   (2) summarise the feedback provided to the authors during the interactive phase (you may cut and past from GitHub);
   (3) evaluate whether and how the authors properly addressed the discussion with the reviewers in the revised version;
   (4) provide further feedback to the authors aiming to improve the paper;
